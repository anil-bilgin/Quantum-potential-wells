# Quantum-potential-wells

This is an introductory tutorial that focuses on how to use finite-difference numerical methods to solve the Schrödinger equation and visualize the resulting wavefunctions for the particle in a box problem. It introduces the necessary concepts, explores the infinite and finite potential wells, as well as the quantum harmonic oscillator. It concludes with solving the Schrödinger equation for an arbitrary, user-defined potential.
