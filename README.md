# Quantum-potential-wells

This is an introductory tutorial that focuses on how to use finite-difference numerical methods to solve the Schrödinger equation and visualize the resulting wavefunctions for the particle in a box problem. It explores the infinite and finite potential wells, the quantum harmonic oscillator and introduces the necessary concepts. It concludes with solving the Schrödinger equation for an arbitrary, user-defined potential.
